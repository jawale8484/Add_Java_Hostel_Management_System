Firstly we would like to welcome you to our official web page and thank you for taking interest in our amazing place of joy called Hostel Shappy.<br /><br />

Hostel Shappy is one of the newest hostels in Zagreb. Situated in the very heart of the city, it provides its customers with an opportunity to fall in love with Zagreb by starting their journey inside out.  Surrounded with the town's finest offerings, the hostel is situated in the pedestrian zone with it's own parking area (reservation in advance needed) and just a minute walk from the Main Street and Main Square in Zagreb. Thanks to its wonderful location, customers are given a great chance to explore the best of what Zagreb has to offer. The citys best cafe bars, restaurants and nightclubs are all at hand, including numerous cultural sightseeings. <br />
<br />
The Upper Town, where the Croatian Parliament is located, is the citys oldest landmark and also a small distance from our hostel.<br />
<br />
Wishing to create a cozy environment for travelers and tourists to enjoy while they are visiting Zagreb, our ultimate goal is to make their stay a unique experience. With this vision in mind, we have gathered a group of young, hard-working and communicative individuals to help us develop our ideas and make our hostel your best choice.<br /><br />
Our hostel consist of 14 very originally decorated rooms, each personalized with a different style of it's own. This includes 43 possible beds. When we were developing our rooms, we put a lot of thought in their appearance. We have tried to match different tastes by giving all of our guests a piece of their own personality expressed through the accommodation that we offer. Exploring this, we came up with a lot of interesting surroundings. First off we have the special and loving "Romantic room" designed for couples who want a bit of their own space and privacy. Next, we have "Green room" and "Stripey room" which both have their own special feel to it. What we also offer are rooms designed for bigger groups, like "Happy room" and "Swag room". "Cool Suite" on the other hand, consist of two separate bedrooms and has its own private bathroom. In the summer of 2013, we have upgraded our hostel with eight new rooms. All of them are deluxe category and have their own private bathroom. They are ideal for business people and families with children.<br /><br />
All of the rooms listed above are equipped with air-conditioning and free Wi-Fi. Beds in all the rooms are provided with linen.<br /><br />
